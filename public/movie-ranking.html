<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>Best movie related to family, culture, dream. Death is not the end, as long as there are some people still remember you.</p>
<h3>On the Road</h3>
<p>This movie is based one the novel by Jack Keroac.I love the beautiful west sceneries in the movie and also the rebellious spirit of the heroes. I really long to have a road trip in the west of USA.</p>
<h3>Flipped</h3>
<p>I have watched this movies for many times. The love from a young age is really something precious. I was moved by Jully's love to the tree also. Sitting on the tree was the memory of my childhood also.</p>
